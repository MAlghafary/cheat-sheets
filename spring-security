-- Spring Security concepts :
1- Principle : Any user,device,or system that would like to interact with your application 
2- Authentication: A process by which your application makes sure that the principal is who they claim to be.
3- Credentials: When a principal tries to interact with your application, the authentication process kicks in and challenges 
the principal to pass on some values.One such example is a username/password combination and these values are called credentials.
The authentication process validates the principal's passed-in credentials against a data store and replies back
with the appropriate result.
